# Titanic-Survival-Predictions
I use datasets from Kaggle to predict who survived on the Titanic. 
To do so I use a logistic regression model.
I chose features after careful analysis of each of them on Excel (more details in the Excel sheet titled Analysis).
I varied my split size of the trainng data to reduce overfitting and also determine the most important regressors to include.
MY model had an R^2 of 0.77. Thus it captures the variation in the data accurately and hence should have good predictive capabilities.
